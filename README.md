# <Pre-Work Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This prework study guide was created for student going through the Front End web Develpment Bootcamp prework. It contains some important notes and tips for users embaking on their coding journey for the first time. The topics covered in this guide are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. The motivation and reason behind this project was to build the foundations for my journey in coding, as well as to help and future students that are embarking on their own journey. Future students will be able to use this website as a basic study guide and some of the built in features will also help them choose what to study first. Working on this project has provided me with an amazing introduction to coding, I have learnt how to navigate GitHub, how to read and understand code as well as reverse engineering it to find bugs and correct them in order to ensure operations run smoothly.
